  description: Example nginx package to demonstrate Zarf variables

# Constants are defined on package create and do not change on deploy
# This demonstrates setting the nginx version to bake into the package using a package variable (PKG_TMPL)
# NOTE: package templates (PKG_TMPL) only apply to zarf.yaml files so defining this here turns into ###ZARF_CONST_NGINX_VERSION### on deploy
# ALSO NOTE: the PKG_TMPL is surrounded by quotes ("") inside of the zarf.yaml, while this is not required for deploy-time variables, PKG_TMPLs will be removed as comments without them
constants:
  - name: NGINX_VERSION
    value: "###ZARF_PKG_TMPL_NGINX_VERSION###"
