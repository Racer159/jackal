# DOS Games in the Cluster!

This example provides the basis for Zarf's [Retro Arcade](../../docs/13-walkthroughs/3-deploy-a-retro-arcade.md) tutorial.  It deploys a Dos Games arcade into the cluster and provides an easy way to connect and play games.

:::note

In this example, there is no "GitOps" service. Zarf is only showing off its ability to act as a standard means of packaging, distribution, and runtime.
