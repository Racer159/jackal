# Retro Arcade

This example provides the basis for Jackal's [Retro Arcade](../../docs/5-jackal-tutorials/3-deploy-a-retro-arcade.md) tutorial.  It deploys a Dos Games arcade into the cluster and provides an easy way to connect and play games.

:::note

In this example, there is no requirement for a "GitOps" service; Jackal is only showing off its ability to act as a standard means of packaging, distribution, and deployment runtime.
