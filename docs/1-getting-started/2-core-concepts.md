# Core Concepts

Now, assuming you're familiar with Kubernetes, AirGap, and GitOps from [Understanding the Basics](../1-getting-started/1-understand-the-basics.md), we can get started on the core concepts of Jackal.

## Jackal Concepts

- [**Jackal Package**](../3-create-a-jackal-package/1-jackal-packages.md) - A binary file that contains the instructions and dependencies necessary to install an application on a system.
- [**Jackal Component**](../3-create-a-jackal-package/2-jackal-components.md) - A set of defined functionality and resources that build up a package.
- [**Jackal Init Package**](../3-create-a-jackal-package/3-jackal-init-package.md) - The initial package that lays the groundwork for other packages.
