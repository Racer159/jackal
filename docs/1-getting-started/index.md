:::note

This quick start requires you to already have:

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager installed on your machine.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed and running on your machine.

For more install options please visit our [Installing Jackal page](./0-installing-jackal.md).

## macOS Commands

```bash
# To install Jackal with Homebrew simply run:
brew tap defenseunicorns/tap && brew install jackal

# Next, you will need a Kubernetes cluster. This example uses KIND.
brew install kind && kind delete cluster && kind create cluster

# Then, you need to initialize the cluster with Jackal:
jackal init
# (Select 'Y' to download the default init package)
# (Select 'Y' to confirm deployment)
# (Select optional components as desired)

# Now you are ready to deploy any Jackal Package, try out our Retro Arcade!!
jackal package deploy oci://ü¶Ñ/dos-games:1.0.0-$(uname -m) --key=https://jackal.dev/cosign.pub
# (Select 'Y' to confirm deployment)
```

## Linux Commands

```bash
# To install Jackal with Homebrew simply run:
brew tap defenseunicorns/tap && brew install jackal

# Next, you will need a Kubernetes cluster. This example uses KinD.
brew install kind && kind delete cluster && kind create cluster
# (Note: you don't need 'KinD' if you have 'root' access since Jackal includes 'k3s' as an optional component)

# Then, you need to initialize the cluster, following the prompts to download and select components
jackal init
# (Select 'Y' to download the default init package)
# (Select 'Y' to confirm deployment)
# (Select 'N' for 'k3s' - this only works when run as 'root')
# (Select other optional components as desired)

# Now you are ready to deploy any Jackal Package, try out our Retro Arcade!!
jackal package deploy oci://ü¶Ñ/dos-games:1.0.0-$(uname -m) --key=https://jackal.dev/cosign.pub
# (Select 'Y' to confirm deployment)
```
