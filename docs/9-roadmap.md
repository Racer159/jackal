# Roadmap

:::caution Hard Hat Area
This page is still being developed. More content will be added soon!
:::

The project roadmap for Zarf is hosted on a [GitHub Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/defenseunicorns/projects/1). There, you can see what we're working on and what work we're prioritizing.

If you want to add bug reports or feature requests to be considered on our roadmap, please feel free to [add an issue](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/issues) on the GitHub repository.


## GA Release

Right now, Zarf is still in its 'beta' phase. We are working on a few final things before we release the official 1.0 general availability (GA) release. The work still needed for the GA release can be found on the roadmap with [this filter](https://github.com/orgs/defenseunicorns/projects/1/views/1?filterQuery=repo%3A%22defenseunicorns%2Fzarf%22+milestone%3A%22zarf+ga%22).
