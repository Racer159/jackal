<!-- Auto-generated by hack/gen-cli-docs.sh -->

Tears down Jackal and removes its components from the environment

## Synopsis

Tear down Jackal.

Deletes everything in the 'jackal' namespace within your connected k8s cluster.

If Jackal deployed your k8s cluster, this command will also tear your cluster down by searching through /opt/jackal for any scripts that start with 'jackal-clean-' and executing them. Since this is a cleanup operation, Jackal will not stop the teardown if one of the scripts produce an error.

If Jackal did not deploy your k8s cluster, this command will delete the Jackal namespace, delete secrets and labels that only Jackal cares about, and optionally uninstall components that Jackal deployed onto the cluster. Since this is a cleanup operation, Jackal will not stop the uninstalls if one of the resources produce an error while being deleted.

```
jackal destroy --confirm [flags]

## Options

```
      --confirm             REQUIRED. Confirm the destroy action to prevent accidental deletions
  -h, --help                help for destroy
      --remove-components   Also remove any installed components outside the jackal namespace
