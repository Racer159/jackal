# zarf tools registry version
<!-- Auto-generated by hack/gen-cli-docs.sh -->

Print the version

## Synopsis

The version string is completely dependent on how the binary was built, so you should not depend on the version format. It may change without notice.

This could be an arbitrary string, if specified via -ldflags.
This could also be the go module version, if built with go modules (often "(devel)").

```
zarf tools registry version [flags]
