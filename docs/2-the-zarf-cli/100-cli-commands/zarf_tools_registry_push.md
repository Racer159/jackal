# zarf tools registry push
<!-- Auto-generated by docs/gen-cli-docs.sh -->

Push local image contents to a remote registry

## Synopsis

If the PATH is a directory, it will be read as an OCI image layout. Otherwise, PATH is assumed to be a docker-style tarball.

```
zarf tools registry push PATH IMAGE [flags]
```

## Options

```
  -h, --help                help for push
      --image-refs string   path to file where a list of the published image references will be written
      --index               push a collection of images as a single index, currently required if PATH contains multiple images
```

## Options inherited from parent commands

```
  -a, --architecture string   Architecture for OCI images and Zarf packages
      --insecure              Allow access to insecure registries and disable other recommended security enforcements such as package checksum and signature validation. This flag should only be used if you have a specific reason and accept the reduced security posture.
  -l, --log-level string      Log level when running Zarf. Valid options are: warn, info, debug, trace (default "info")
      --no-log-file           Disable log file creation
      --no-progress           Disable fancy UI progress bars, spinners, logos, etc
      --tmpdir string         Specify the temporary directory to use for intermediate files
      --zarf-cache string     Specify the location of the Zarf cache directory (default "~/.zarf-cache")
```
