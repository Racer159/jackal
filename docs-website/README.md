This is the docs site for [Jackal](https://github.com/Racer159/jackal), a declarative air gap solution for Kubernetes.  This site is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator created by Facebook.

## Prerequisites

This site requires `nodejs` and `npm` so install it if you haven't already.

```bash
# FOR LINUX (Ubuntu)
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install nodejs
$ sudo apt install npm

# FOR MAC (Homebrew)
$ brew install nodejs
```

## Installation

To install the required dependencies run the following:

```bash
npm ci
```

## Running

There are two ways to run the site locally, the simplest being the following:

```bash
npm run start
```

This will open a browser window that will let you see the built site.

> ⚠️ *Note, `npm run start` will not perform some link checking or build the search index.*

To perform a full build and to run it locally you should run the following:

```bash
npm run build
npm run serve
```

## Deployment

To deploy the site, push your changes into a branch and open a PR.  [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) will generate a preview for you and a PR approver to see your changes.  Once the approver is happy with the changes they can approve and merge the PR and it will be pushed to production.
