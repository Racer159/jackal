## Introduction

This tutorial describes how to use Big Bang with Zarf for Air Gap deployments through the use of the Big Bang Zarf extension. If you are not familiar with Big Bang you can learn more about it here: https://p1.dso.mil/products/big-bang, but in short it is a DevSecOps platform that contains many useful tools for building, managing, and running software projects while adhering to the [United States Department of Defense DevSecOps Reference Design](https://public.cyber.mil/devsecops/).

Zarf integrates with Big Bang through the use of an extension that simplifies the selection of Big Bang packages and the pulling of the required artifacts to deploy those packages in an Air Gap.

### Limitations

The current version of this extension requires Big Bang version `1.54.0` or later, and is not fully integrated into the `zarf package remove` lifecycle (see the [Big Bang example](../../examples/big-bang/README.md) for how to introduce those lifecycle hooks manually).  Zarf also relies on [helm.sh/images annotations](https://github.com/helm/community/blob/main/hips/hip-0015.md) to discover images within charts (e.g. [GitLab](https://repo1.dso.mil/big-bang/product/packages/gitlab/-/blob/main/chart/Chart.yaml#L61)) - this is a relatively new feature for Big Bang so if you see an `ImagePullBackOff` error, check that these annotations are set correctly for the sub charts you are using. To work around this issue if you come across it, simply add the missing image to the images list on the same component that contains the Big Bang extension like the following:

```
components:
  - name: bigbang
    required: true
    images:
      - registry1.dso.mil/ironbank/gitlab/gitlab/gitlab-exporter:15.9.2
    extensions:
      bigbang:
        version: 1.54.0
```

## System Requirements

Big Bang requires a reasonably powerful `amd64` system that scales up with the number of components deployed.  We recommend at least `32 GB` of RAM and a high-speed internet connection to complete this tutorial.

To learn more about Big Bang's requirements in general, see their documentation: https://docs-bigbang.dso.mil/latest/docs/prerequisites/minimum-hardware-requirements/

## Prerequisites

Before beginning this tutorial you will need the following:

- A local copy of the Zarf repository
  - `git clone https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf.git`
- A kubernetes cluster onto which you can deploy Zarf and Big Bang
- The latest version of the Zarf `cli`
  - Follow instructions on https://zarf.dev/install/
- An account on `https://registry1.dso.mil` to retrieve Big Bang images
  - You can register for an account [here](https://login.dso.mil/auth/realms/baby-yoda/protocol/openid-connect/registrations?client_id=account&response_type=code)

:::note

If you followed the [Setting Up a Local Kubernetes Cluster](./index.md#setting-up-a-local-kubernetes-cluster) instructions for other Zarf tutorials, you will need to pass additional command flags to `k3d` for it to work with Big Bang.  See the below to create a working cluster:

```bash
k3d cluster create
  # Required by the PLG stack
  --volume /etc/machine-id:/etc/machine-id

  # Required for Istio ingress
  --k3s-arg "--disable=traefik@server:0"
  --port 80:80@loadbalancer
  --port 443:443@loadbalancer

  # Required for TLS to work correctly with kubectl
  --k3s-arg "--tls-san=$SERVER_IP@server:0"
  --api-port 6443
```

If you tweak the packages that are deployed there may be other configuration options you need to specify, please refer to the [Big Bang documentation](https://docs-bigbang.dso.mil/latest/) for more details.

## Package Creation

The below section covers creating and tuning the Big Bang package:

### Setup

By default, Big Bang uses images from [Iron Bank](https://p1.dso.mil/products/iron-bank) which will require you to set your login credentials for [Registry One](https://registry1.dso.mil) (see [pre-requisites](#pre-requisites) for information on account setup).

```bash
# Authenticate to https://registry1.dso.mil/, then retrieve your CLI secret from your User Profile and run the following:
set +o history
export REGISTRY1_USERNAME=<REPLACE_ME>
export REGISTRY1_CLI_SECRET=<REPLACE_ME>
echo $REGISTRY1_CLI_SECRET | zarf tools registry login registry1.dso.mil --username $REGISTRY1_USERNAME --password-stdin
set -o history
```

Now navigate to the `examples/big-bang` folder within the Zarf repository you cloned in the [pre-requisites](#pre-requisites) section.

### Configure Big Bang

Within the `examples/big-bang` folder you will see a `zarf.yaml` that has the following [component](../3-create-a-zarf-package/2-zarf-components.md) defined:

```yaml
components:
  - name: bigbang
    required: true
    extensions:
      bigbang:
        version: 1.54.0
        skipFlux: false
        valuesFiles:
          - config/minimal.yaml #turns on just istio
          - config/ingress.yaml # adds istio certs for *.bigbang.dev
          - config/kyverno.yaml # turns on kyverno
          - config/loki.yaml # turns on loki and monitoring
```

This component uses the `bigbang` extension to define the version of Big Bang to use and the values files to apply.  Feel free to inspect and configure the values.yaml files as you wish and to learn more about Big Bang's configuration see their values guide: https://docs-bigbang.dso.mil/latest/docs/guides/using-bigbang/values-guide/

:::note

The `valuesFiles` are applied from top to bottom and will apply the last value that was provided for any given key.

:::

:::note

This extension requires Big Bang version `1.54.0` or later.

:::


### Package Big Bang

When you're ready to continue you can create a Big Bang package by running the following command in `examples/big-bang`:

```bash
zarf package create
```

Now wait for the package creation to complete and you should see a `zarf-package-big-bang-example-amd64-x.x.x.tar.zst` file in the directory.


## Package Deployment

The below section covers deploying the Big Bang package from the previous section:

### Initialize Zarf

Before you can deploy the Big Bang package you must first initialize Zarf on the cluster you created in the [pre-requisites](#pre-requisites) section.  To do so you can run the following:

```bash
# Initialize Zarf (interactively)
zarf init
# Make these choices at the prompts
# ? Do you want to download this init package? Yes
# ? Deploy this Zarf package? Yes
# ? Deploy the k3s component? No
# ? Deploy the logging component? No
# ? Deploy the git-server component? Yes

# (Optional) Inspect the results
zarf tools k9s
```

:::note

The `git-server` component is required by Big Bang as it uses it as a source for Flux deployments.

:::


### Deploy Big Bang

Now you are ready to deploy Big Bang, and can do so with the following in the `examples/big-bang` directory:

```bash
# Deploy Big Bang (interactively)
zarf package deploy
# Make these choices at the prompts
# ? Choose or type the package file [tab for suggestions] zarf-package-big-bang-example-amd64-x.x.x.tar.zst
# ? Deploy this Zarf package? Yes
```

### See The Results

Once the install completes you can inspect the results and watch the Big Bang components deploy using the following:

```bash
zarf tools k9s

# To view different k8s objects you can use the following:

# Helm Releases:
# :hr [Enter]
# Pods:
# :pods [Enter]
# Services:
# :svc [Enter]
# Secrets:
# :secret [Enter]
# ConfigMaps:
# :configmap [Enter]

# When you are done use the following to quit
# :q [Enter]
```

## Package Removal

The Big Bang extension is not fully integrated into the Zarf package remove lifecycle (see [known issues](#known-issues)). To get around this limitation, an onRemove.before action has been added to the bigbang component in the zarf.yaml file that ensures all the Big Bang resources are torn down in the correct order when Zarf is used to remove the package:

```bash
zarf package remove big-bang-example --confirm
```

## Troubleshooting

See the Troubleshooting section of the Big Bang Quick Start for help troubleshooting the Big Bang deployment: https://repo1.dso.mil/big-bang/bigbang/-/blob/master/docs/guides/deployment-scenarios/quickstart.md#troubleshooting

Also, ensure that you have followed all of the steps required in the [pre-requisites](#pre-requisites) section and have reviewed the [known issues](#known-issues).

If you feel that the error you are encountering is one with Zarf feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/issues/new/choose) or reach out via [slack](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C03B6BJAUJ3).
