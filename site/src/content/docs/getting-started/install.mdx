title: Installing Zarf

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Depending on your operating system and specific setup there are a few ways you can get the Zarf CLI onto your machine:

- [Install from Homebrew](#installing-from-the-defense-unicorns-homebrew-tap).
- [Download a prebuilt binary](#downloading-a-prebuilt-binary-from-our-github-releases).
- [Build the CLI](#building-the-cli-from-scratch) from scratch.

[Post-Install](#post-install-steps), you can verify that Zarf is correctly on your `$PATH` and that you have an 'init' package for your environment and Zarf version.

## Official - Installing the CLI with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="macOS">

```

## Official - GitHub Releases

All [Zarf releases](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/releases) on GitHub include prebuilt binaries that you can download and use. We offer range of combinations of OS and architecture for you to choose from.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Linux">

To download Zarf on Linux you can run the following (replacing `<zarf-version>` with a version of Zarf):

```bash
ZARF_VERSION=<zarf-version>
ZARF_ARCH=$([ $(uname -m) == "x86_64" ] && echo "amd64" || echo "arm64";)

curl -sL https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/releases/download/${ZARF_VERSION}/zarf_${ZARF_VERSION}_Linux_${ZARF_ARCH} -o zarf
chmod +x zarf
```

On most Linux distributions, you can also install the binary onto your `$PATH` by simply moving the downloaded binary to the `/usr/local/bin` directory:

```bash
sudo mv zarf /usr/local/bin/zarf
```

<TabItem label="macOS">

To download Zarf on macOS you can run the following (replacing `<zarf-version>` with a version of Zarf):

```bash
ZARF_VERSION=<zarf-version>
ZARF_ARCH=$([ $(uname -m) == "x86_64" ] && echo "amd64" || echo "arm64";)

curl -sL https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/releases/download/${ZARF_VERSION}/zarf_${ZARF_VERSION}_Darwin_${ZARF_ARCH} -o zarf
chmod +x zarf
```

You can also install the binary onto your `$PATH` by simply moving the downloaded binary to the `/usr/local/bin` directory:

```bash
sudo mv zarf /usr/local/bin/zarf
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Windows">


To download Zarf on Windows you can run the following (replacing `<zarf-version>` with a version of Zarf and `<zarf-arch>` with either `amd64` or `arm64` depending on your system):

```bash
$ZarfVersion="<zarf-version>"
$ZarfArch="<zarf-arch>"

Start-BitsTransfer -Source "https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/releases/download/$($ZarfVersion)/zarf_$($ZarfVersion)_Windows_$($ZarfArch).exe" -Destination zarf.exe
```

You can also install the binary onto your `$PATH` by moving the downloaded binary to the desired directory and modifying the `$PATH` environment variable to include that directory.

## Community

- `apk add` on [Alpine Linux Edge](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/package/edge/testing/x86_64/zarf)
- `asdf install` with the [ASDF Version Manager](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/asdf-zarf)
- `nix-shell`/`nix-env` with [Nix Packages](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=23.05&show=zarf&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=zarf)
- `pkgx install zarf` with [pkgx](https://pkgx.dev/pkgs/zarf.dev/)

## Building the CLI from Scratch

If you want to build the CLI from scratch, you can do that too. Our local builds depend on [Go 1.21.x](https://golang.org/doc/install) and [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf
cd zarf
make

ls -lah build
```

For additional information, see the [Building Your Own Zarf CLI](/cli/building) page.

## Post-Install Steps

Once you have installed Zarf with one of the above methods, you can verify it is working with the following:

```bash
$ zarf version

vX.X.X  # X.X.X is replaced with the version number of your specific installation
```

:::info

If you are not seeing this then Zarf was not installed onto your `$PATH` correctly. [This $PATH guide](https://zwbetz.com/how-to-add-a-binary-to-your-path-on-macos-linux-windows/) should help with that.

:::

In most usage scenarios ([but not all](../../examples/yolo/README.md)) you will also need an ['init' package](../3-create-a-zarf-package/3-zarf-init-package.md) to be initialized before you deploy your own packages. This is a special Zarf package that initializes a cluster with services that are used to store package resources while in the air gap.

You can get the default 'init' package for your version of Zarf by visiting the [Zarf releases](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/releases) page and downloading it into your working directory or into `~/.zarf-cache/zarf-init-<amd64|arm64>-vX.X.X.tar.zst`.

If you are online on the machine with cluster access you can also run `zarf init` without the `--confirm` flag to be given the option to download the matching version of the default 'init' package or you can use the `zarf tools download-init` command to download a copy to your machine.

:::tip

You can build your own custom 'init' package too if you'd like. For this you should check out the [Creating a Custom 'init' Package Tutorial](../5-zarf-tutorials/8-custom-init-packages.md).
