---

Now, assuming you're familiar with Kubernetes, AirGap, and GitOps from [Understanding the Basics](/getting-started/basics), we can get started on the core concepts of Zarf.

## Concepts

- [**Zarf Package**](/create-a-package/packages) - A binary file that contains the instructions and dependencies necessary to install an application on a system.
- [**Zarf Component**](/create-a-package/components) - A set of defined functionality and resources that build up a package.
- [**Zarf Init Package**](/create-a-package/init-package) - The initial package that lays the groundwork for other packages.
