Zarf enables you to consolidate portions of the internet into a single package that can be conveniently installed at a later time. A Zarf Package is a single tarball file that includes all of the resources and instructions required for efficiently managing a system or capability, even when entirely disconnected from the internet. In this context, a disconnected system refers to a system that either consistently operates in an offline mode or occasionally disconnects from the network.

Once defined, a Zarf Package contains comprehensive instructions on assembling various software components that are to be [deployed onto the targeted system](../4-deploy-a-zarf-package/index.md). The instructions are fully "declarative", meaning that all components are represented by code and automated, eliminating the need for manual intervention.

## Typical Creation Workflow

The general flow of a Zarf package deployment on an existing initialized cluster is as follows:

```shell
# Before creating your package you can lint your zarf.yaml
$ zarf dev lint <directory>

# To create a package run the following:
$ zarf package create <directory>
# - Enter any package templates that have not yet been defined
# - Type "y" to confirm package creation or "N" to cancel

# Once the creation finishes you can interact with the built package
$ zarf inspect <package-name>.tar.zst
# - You should see the specified package's zarf.yaml
# - You can also see the sbom information with `zarf inspect <package-name>.tar.zst --sbom`
```
