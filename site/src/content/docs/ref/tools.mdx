## yq

> aliases: `yq`

Zarf vendors in [yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/) to provide a way to interact with YAML files. 
`yq` is a lightweight and portable command-line YAML processor. It can be used to extract specific parts of a YAML file, replace or delete values, and more.

## archiver

> aliases: `archiver`, `a`

Zarf uses the great [mholt/archiver](https://github.com/mholt/archiver) library as a dependency to create and extract archives. This libarary also offers itself as a standalone tool that can be used to create and extract archives, accessible at [`zarf tools archiver`](/commands/zarf_tools_archiver).

## syft

> aliases: `syft`, `sbom`, `s`

Zarf vendors in [Syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft), a "CLI tool and library for generating a Software Bill of Materials from container images and filesystems". The full Syft CLI is accessible at [`zarf tools sbom`](/commands/zarf_tools_sbom).

## k9s

> aliases: `k9s`, `monitor`, `m`

Zarf vendors in [K9s](https://k9scli.io/), a terminal-based UI to interact with your Kubernetes cluster. K9s is not necessary to deploy, manage, or operate Zarf or its deployed packages, but it is a great tool to use when you want to interact with your cluster.

```bash
zarf tools k9s
```
