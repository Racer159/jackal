To build the Zarf CLI from scratch, you'll need to have the following dependencies configured:

1. The Zarf [repository](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf) cloned to your local machine.
2. Have [Go 1.21.x]((https://go.dev/doc/install)) installed on your PATH.
3. `make` utility installed on your PATH.
   - Instructions to install on macOS with [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/make).
   - Instructions to install on Windows with [Chocolatey](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/make), [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/#/apps?q=make&s=0&d=1&o=true&id=c43ff861c0f1713336e5304d85334a29ffb86317), or [MSYS2](https://packages.msys2.org/package/make).

> If you are running `make` targets other than the `build-cli-*` targets described below, you may need more software installed.  Inspect the `Makefile` at the root of the project to view the commands each target runs.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:defenseunicorns/zarf.git
cd zarf

make # the default make target builds the CLI for the current platform (OS and architecture)
     # you can also run `make build-cli` to build the CLI for all supported platforms
     # the resulting artifacts are stored in the `./build` directory

ls -l build    # list the built CLI binaries
```

:::note[Optimization Note]

The `make build-cli` command builds a binary for each combination of OS and architecture, which may take some time. If you only need a binary for a specific configuration, you can use one of the following commands:

- `make build-cli-mac-intel`
- `make build-cli-mac-apple`
- `make build-cli-linux-amd`
- `make build-cli-linux-arm`
- `make build-cli-windows-amd`
- `make build-cli-windows-arm`
