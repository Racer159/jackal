## Schema Validation

Zarf uses the [Zarf package schema](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/blob/main/zarf.schema.json) to define its configuration files. This schema is used to describe package configuration options and enable the validation of configuration files prior to their use in building a Zarf Package.

### `zarf dev lint`

The [`zarf dev lint`](/commands/zarf_dev_lint) command is used to validate a `zarf.yaml` file against the Zarf schema. This command is useful for ensuring that a `zarf.yaml` file is correctly formatted and adheres to the Zarf schema.

```bash
zarf dev lint <dir>
```

### VSCode

1. Open VS Code.
2. Install the [YAML extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml) by RedHat.
3. Open the VS Code command palette by typing `CTRL/CMD + SHIFT + P`.
4. Type `Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)`into the search bar to open the `settings.json` file.
5. Add the below code to the settings.json config, or modify the existing `yaml.schemas` object to include the Zarf schema.

```json
  "yaml.schemas": {
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/main/zarf.schema.json": "zarf.yaml"
  }
```

:::note

When successfully installed, the `yaml.schema` line will match the color of the other lines within the settings.

#### Specifying Zarf's Schema Version

To ensure consistent validation of the Zarf schema version in a `zarf.yaml` file, it can be beneficial to lock it to a specific version. This can be achieved by appending the following statement to the **first line** of any given `zarf.yaml` file:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/<VERSION>/zarf.schema.json
```

In the above example, `<VERSION>` should be replaced with the specific [Zarf release](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/releases).

### Code Example

## `zarf dev deploy`

:::caution

The `zarf dev deploy` command is meant to be used in **development** environments / workflows. It is **not** meant to be used in **production** environments / workflows.

:::

The `dev deploy` command combines the lifecycle of `package create` and `package deploy` into a single command. This command will:

- Not result in a re-usable tarball / OCI artifact
- Not have any interactive prompts
- Not require `zarf init` to be run (by default, but _is required_ if `--no-yolo` is not set)
- Be able to create+deploy a package in either YOLO mode (default) or prod mode (exposed via `--no-yolo` flag)
- Only build + deploy components that _will_ be deployed (contrasting with `package create` which builds _all_ components regardless of whether they will be deployed)

```bash
# Create and deploy dos-games in yolo mode
$ zarf dev deploy examples/dos-games
```

```bash
# If deploying a package in prod mode, `zarf init` must be run first
$ zarf init --confirm
# Create and deploy dos-games in prod mode
$ zarf dev deploy examples/dos-games --no-yolo
```

## `zarf dev find-images`

Evaluates components in a `zarf.yaml` to identify images specified in their helm charts and manifests.

Components that have `git` repositories that host helm charts can be processed by providing the `--repo-chart-path`.

```bash
$ zarf dev find-images examples/wordpress

components:

  - name: wordpress
    images:
      - docker.io/bitnami/apache-exporter:0.13.3-debian-11-r2
      - docker.io/bitnami/mariadb:10.11.2-debian-11-r21
      - docker.io/bitnami/wordpress:6.2.0-debian-11-r18
```
