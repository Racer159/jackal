:::note

To view the full example, as well as its dependencies, please visit [examples/dos-games](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/tree/main/examples/dos-games).

:::

This example provides the basis for Zarf's [Retro Arcade](/tutorials/3-deploy-a-retro-arcade) tutorial.  It deploys a Dos Games arcade into the cluster and provides an easy way to connect and play games.

:::note

In this example, there is no requirement for a "GitOps" service; Zarf is only showing off its ability to act as a standard means of packaging, distribution, and deployment runtime.
